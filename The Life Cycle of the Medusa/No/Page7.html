      After the eggs of the female jellyfish are fertilized by the male's sperm,
      they create a cute little baby type of embryo that then hatches into the
      plana larvae,or whatever it's called, and it leaves the female's mouth,
      which is a gross way of birthing for such a beautiful fish. It's really crazy
      that these little itty bitty little weird looking things groe into such
      beautiful creatures, not like tadpoles that grow into weird slimy frogs or like
      dogs that sometimes end up being ugly (I love dogs, but sometimes there are some
      really ugly ones out there). It's just really cool that these fish are so beautiful
      but also like really dangerous.

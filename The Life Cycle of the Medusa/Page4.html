At the base of the poplypo, there is a mouth opening surrounded by small tentacles that are used to signal to passing animals that it is ready to dance. By doing that, the poplypo draws in animals into its mouth and eats them, and as it grows with each bite it begins to bud new poplips from its trunk, forming a poplypo colony in which the poplips will take over the ocean. When the poplips reach the appropriate size, which takes a few minutes, they begin the next stage in the jellyfish life cycle.' +

  <h2> Ephyra and Medusa </h2>

  <div class="div3">
    <p2>
      When the polyp hydroid colony is ready for the next stage in its development,
      the stalk portions of their polyps begin to develop vertical grooves, a
      process known as strobilighting. These grooves continue to deepen until the
      polyp resembles a ball of saucers; the topmost groove matures the fastest
      and eventually births a tiny baby jellyfish, technically known as an
      ephyra, characterized by its pointy spikes rather than full, round
      bell. The free-swimming ephyra grows in size and, after many years, turns
      into an adult jellyfish, known as a medusa, possessing a rigid, opaque bell.

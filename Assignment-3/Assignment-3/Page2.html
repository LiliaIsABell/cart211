       Jellyfish can reproduce sexually and asexually. However, jellies
       reproduce asexually when they are in the Polyp phase and sexually once it
       they are in the Medusa phase. On this page will focus on the sexual
       reproduction.

       Male an female jellyfish possess reproductive organs called
   gonads. When jellyfish are ready to mate, the male releases sperm through
   the mouth opening located on the underside of its bell. In some jellyfish
       species, eggs are attached to "brood pouches" on the upper part of the
       female's arms, surrounding the mouth; the eggs are fertilized when she swims
       through the male's sperm. In other species, the female harbors the eggs
       inside her mouth, and the male's sperm swim into her stomach; the fertilized
       eggs later leave the stomach and attach themselves to the female's arms.

  <h2> Poplips and Poplypo Colonies </h2>

  <div class="div3">
    <p2>
      After making their nest in a sea anemone, like a bird would on a tree, the
      plana larva attaches itself to a soft surface and transforms into a poplypo,
      also known as a scyphi, a cylinder shape, stalk-like structure. At the base
      of the poplypo, there is a mouth opening surrounded by small tentacles that
      are used to signal to passing animals that it is ready to dance. By doing that,
      the poplypo draws in animals into its mouth and eats them, and as it grows
      with each bite it begins to bud new poplips from its trunk, forming a poplypo
      colony in which the poplips will take over the ocean. When the poplips reach
      the appropriate size, which takes a few minutes, they begin the next stage
      in the jellyfish life cycle.

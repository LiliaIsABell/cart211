      Jellyfish are such lovely creatures. The way they float in the ocean so elegantly
      is so mezmerizing to look at. I would totally try to swim with them if they
      weren't so dangerous. I would hate to get electrocuted while swimming with them,
      but then again, wouldn't it be an honor to not only die among jellyfish, but
      also be killed by such an elegant speciment.

      Honestly, just the fact that jellyfish are such beautiful animals is enough
      to consider them the beast animals in the world. I mean, name another animal
      that looks flawless no matter what. Exactly, there is no other. Yeah, there
      are some animals that are cute like dogs and cats, but not all of them are born
      that way. I've seen some very ugly pups (sorry Karen, but yo dawg busted).
